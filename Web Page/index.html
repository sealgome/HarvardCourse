  <p>Galito came to the family in January 2021, becoming the greatest love and reason for happiness He is loving and sociable: he has many children friends with whom he shares: some afternoons they knock on the apartment door and say "Good afternoon, please, can Galito come out?" Every time one of your family members returns to house, he runs everywhere. He is very intelligent and sensitive, that is why, at night, when a member of the family has not returned, he appears restless and sad, he sits looking at the front door. Galo likes to go to the bike path, run every time they have the opportunity; hence his athletic build. Galito is playful and when other dogs bark at him or try to scare him, he thinks it's a game, because he only knows about love.</p>
